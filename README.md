# Game-Of-Life-ASCII
 I decided to make my own version of the well known Conway's Game of Life. I will work using Robert Martin's code etiquette to see how I like it. I am writing the game in Python, fully ascii. In the end I hope to make it cross compatible but for now it is only Windows functional.
